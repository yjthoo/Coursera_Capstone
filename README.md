# Travel Recommendation System

This project presents a proof of concept for a travel recommendation system that would take into account a user's preferences in terms of locations that they have already visted and suggests similar locations in their destination city. 

## Future work

Obtain customer feedback and reivews from venues and/or tourist locations within each area such that the data is more representative of the vibe/atmosphere of these areas.
